# Handwritten Image to Text Project

## Overview
The Handwritten Image to Text project utilizes optical character recognition (OCR) technology to convert images of handwritten text into editable digital text. This project aims to improve the accuracy of handwriting recognition, facilitating the digitization of handwritten notes and documents for easier processing and analysis.

## Features
- **OCR Technology**: Converts handwritten images into editable text.
- **Deep Learning Models**: Utilizes advanced models for improved recognition accuracy.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simplifies the process of uploading images and retrieving text.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (or any relevant OCR libraries)
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- PIL (Pillow)

## Installation
To set up the environment, run the following command:

```bash
pip install tensorflow opencv-python numpy pillow
```

## Usage
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. Place your handwritten image files in the project directory or provide the path to the image in the code.

3. Update the image file path variable in the code to point to your handwritten image.

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python handwritten_to_text.py
   ```

5. The script will process the image and output the extracted text.

## Example
To test the project, use a sample image of handwritten text. The analysis will provide the extracted text in the output.

## Future Work
- Enhance the model to support various handwriting styles and fonts.
- Implement a GUI for a more interactive user experience.
- Explore integration with cloud services for scalable processing.
